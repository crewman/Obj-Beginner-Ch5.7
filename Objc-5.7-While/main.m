 // A neat use of mod, used here to reverse the digits of an entered integer:

 /*
      So the way this works, as I understand it: 
  
      input a number: 1024
      
        1024 % 10  = 4  
        1024 / 10 = 102.4 (but because these are integers it's actually) = 102
            
            102 % 10 = 2
            102 / 10 = 10
                
                10 % 10 = 0
                10 / 10 = 1
                    
                    1 % 10 = 1
                    1 / 10 = 0
 
  In each iteration the value of inputnumber % 10 = flipped integer, and can then be printed. This 
  would result in a program that outputs in reverse order the number the user inputs. 
  
  My thought is possibly using arrays, take the input:
  
    input a number: 1024
                    ^  ^
                    |  |__ input[1,3]
            input[1,0]
 
 
  I guess you'd need a loop of sorts to count the max array filled with info you care about:
  
  for (i = 0, i ,  ){
  
      max_num = 0 + 1; \\ When assigning digits to an array, keep a an array counter.
  
  }
  
 
  and then print the output by reversing the input: for ( something | i,j| ) { printf input[1,maxnum - j] } 
  or something:
  ÃŸ
  so like:
  
                #1: printf( input[1,3] );
                    
                    #2: printf( input[1,2] );
  
                        #3: printf( input[1,1] );
                        
                            #4: printf( input[1,0] );

  
  
  Anyway, it seems clunkier than the way the book did it, with at least one, probably 2 loops. I am not sure if there is any advantage to my method either, but it's nifty!
